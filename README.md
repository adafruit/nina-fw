# Adafruit fork of the Arduino NINA-W102 firmware

This is the Adafruit fork of the Arduino NINA-W102 firmware. The original
repository is located at https://github.com/arduino/nina-fw

This firmware uses [Espressif's IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf)

## Building

The firmware shipped in Adafruit's products is compiled following these
instructions. These may differ from the instructions included in the
original Arduino firmware repository.

1. [Download the ESP32 toolchain](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.2/get-started/index.html#setup-toolchain)
1. Extract it and add it to your `PATH`: `export PATH=$PATH:<path/to/toolchain>/bin`
1. Clone **v3.2** of the IDF: `git clone --branch v3.2 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git`
1. Set the `IDF_PATH` environment variable: `export IDF_PATH=<path/to/idf>`
1. Run `make firmware` to build the firmware (in the directory of this read me)
1. You should have a file named `NINA_W102-x.x.x.bin` in the top directory
1. Use appropriate tools (esptool.py, appropriate pass-through firmware etc)
   to load this binary file onto your board.

## Azure Iot Hub

1. Clone the https://github.com/espressif/esp-azure repo one level higher in your directory structure. Make sure to clone submodules.
1. Uncomment the ``#define COMMAND_AZURE_IOT_HUB`` in ``CommandHandler.h``
1. Build again
