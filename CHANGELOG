## Arduino firmware

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.5.0 - 2022.07.09

* Add BSD-like sockets APIs (on command range 0x70 -> 0x7f)
* Fix ADC readings range (fuill scale range is now ~2.7V)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.8 - 2021.07.29

* Fix issue due to repeated status()/connected() call (#73)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.7 - 2021.06.18

Functionally identical with 1.4.6, except version number.

This release was made necessary because bad arguments were used with the FirmwareUploader tool
on Arduino Cloud for updating NINA-FWs (effectively deleting all certificates except the one
fetched by the tool). Now all Cloud-Connected NINA-FWs need to be updated once more which is
only possible by incrementing the firmware version number.

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.6 - 2021.06.09

* Add a new root certificate list including detailed instructions how to update it (#71)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.5 - 2021.05.05

* Adding support for Arduino RP2040 Nano Connect (#67)
* Added ISRG Root X1 for LetsEncrypt (#68)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.4 - 2021.04.13

* Adding support for Arduino RP2040 Nano Connect (#64)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.3 - 2021.01.29

* Do not immediately close connection after 1 failed write (#62)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.2 - 2021.01.28

Port BearSSL + crypto integration to NINA (#57). This allows to offload BearSSL for Arduino IoT Cloud applications to the nina module, drastically saving on flash/RAM.

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.1 - 2020.08.17

* Direct download of OTA binary to Nina storage and verifying both CRC and length (#53)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.4.0 - 2020.07.13

* Adding API which allows to utilize the nina file system as an external storage module for the host CPU (#32)
* Fixing bug leading to packet corruption in situation of high UDP traffic (#49)
* Fixing bug leading to missing packets and connection drop (#50)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.3.0 - 2019.12.23

* Fixed channel's assignement for WiFi.beginAP(...)
* Fixed set host name API begin connecting to AP
* Updated to IDF v3.3.1
* Added WPA2 Enterprise support (PEAP/MSCHAPv2 + EAP-TLS)

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.2.4 - 2019.06.14

* Disabled CONFIG_LWIP_DHCP_DOES_ARP_CHECK
* Added small delay to WiFiUDP.parsePacket() allow other tasks to run
* Updated to esp-idf v3.3 branch

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.2.3 - 2018.04.09

* Fixed socket connections hanging when WiFi is disconnected
* Fixed issues where DNS server could be reset to 0.0.0.0 on WiFi re-connections
* Updated to use esp-idf 3.1.3

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.2.1 - 2018.11.16

* Fixed factory SSL certificates being incorrectly parsed due to OOM caused by Bluetooth inclusion

Arduino NINA-W102 firmware 1.2.0 - 2018.11.13
